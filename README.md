# TikTok-Video-Downloader
Downloads TikTok videos for you.

## Information
This tool downloads TikTok videos by simply using the URLs the user grants. As a further matter, it excludes the TikTok outro. I am aware this is excessively straightforward; it started off with me trying to develop an effective one-liner but figured why not add a loop — and so on. That is the reason I uploaded this basic code.

## Usage
- Python 3.8 or above is required.
- I develop for Windows machines only and do not intentionally support other operating systems.
- If you do not already have the **requests** library installed, run setup.py — make sure PIP is added to PATH.
1. Run main.py.
2. Paste a TikTok video URL — e.g. https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/1234567891234567891.
3. Wait a few seconds, and it should be downloaded shortly.
